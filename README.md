# Escape the scan chain -- block4

This project demos much faster i/o and clocking than normally allowed by the TinyTapeout3 scan chain (a.k.a. "escaping the scan chain").

Please see the documentation at the main SpinalHDL based [project](https://github.com/diferential/sc-rv-tt03). This is block 4 of 4 almost identical blocks.
